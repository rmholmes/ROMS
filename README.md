My ROMS repo

NOTE: This repo must remain private. The main ROMS code repository is protected by a login/registration process.

## The SAPEQmaster branch
This is my master branch containing all the added Simple Atmosphere code (mostly associated with the cpp options ABLM - an atmospheric boundary layer model, and STATS_ENSO or SVD_ENSO - a statistical ENSO atmosphere).

## The master branch
This contains the main ROMS master branch with none of my modifications.

## The SAPEQ_TIW_ENSO_Stochastic branch
Contains the version of the code used for Holmes et al (2018) Climate Dynamics

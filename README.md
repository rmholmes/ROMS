# ROMS
My ROMS repo

## The SAPEQmaster branch
This is my master branch containing all the added Simple Atmosphere code (mostly associated with the cpp options ABLM - an atmospheric boundary layer model, and STATS_ENSO or SVD_ENSO - a statistical ENSO atmosphere). The documentation for these changes is contained in the following manuscript:

- (Holmes R. M., S. McGregor, A. Santoso and M.H. England (2019) Contribution of Tropical Instability Waves to ENSO Irregularity, Climate Dynamics, 52, 1837-1855)[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4217-0].

## The master branch
This contains the main ROMS master branch with none of my modifications.

## The SAPEQ_TIW_ENSO_Stochastic branch
Contains the version of the code used for Holmes et al (2018) Climate Dynamics

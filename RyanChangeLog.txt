23/4/14 - Setup to compile on cluster;
	1 makefile_original saved (revision 734)
	2 makefile altered for cees-cluster run on PEQ_BMIX, saved as
	  makefile_cees-cluster
	3 Linux-gfortran - the lines containing: 
	
		ifeq "${FC_TEST}" ""
		$(SCRATCH_DIR)/ran_state.o: FFLAGS += -fno-strict-overflow
		endif
	  had been commented out in the OLD_ROMS version, may need to
		do it again? -> Yes I did!!
	4 Analytical files should be in the INC directory of the
		simulation run.
        5 Changed mod_scalars.F at line 1335 to use the higher K0
		parameters in KPP. This is surround by a cpp option to
		ONLY ACTIVATE IF PEQMIX IS ACTIVATED!

16/5/16 - This working copy seems to be too old to work with
          svn. Therefore I have downloaded the most recent version of
          ROMS retaining the make files and the Linux-gfortran file
          from above. I have not changed the mod_scalars.F
          file. Only needed to change nc-config to nf-config in
          Linux-gfortran.mk (nc-config masked by anaconda version on
          Path).
        - Upwelling test case successfully run with mpi, results in
          Testing/

17/8/16 - Redownloaded ROMS trunk as a git repository using the
          command
          git svn clone --prefix=origin/ --username Ryan_Holmes https://www.myroms.org/svn/src/trunk ./
        - Now should be able to make changes and track them using git
          (no longer an svn repository). Should be able to include
          remote updates using git svn rebase, git svn fetch
          etc. However, these are currently seg faulting leaving an
          error signal 11.
        - Changes from above included here (Linux-gfortran.mk and
          makefile), plus OLD_ROMS (contains NUMDIF) and
          OLD_ROMS_14_8_13 saved in separate folders.
